    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Podcast</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is Podcast all about?  How does it help us in our concert?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Chosen Category</h2>
      <p style="text-align: center;">Podcasts is the category we've selected. Podcasts that discuss the situation in Sitio Bebe and suggest ways to help, such as the concert, are also available. It's like listening to therapy podcasts as a teenager, together with podcasts where people discuss music and daily life. The podcast's entertainment value is its main goal. With this, we may amuse the audience by going live on various social media sites like Facebook, YouTube, etc., and providing them with news on the Sitio Bebe and its current crisis. </p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">By using a podcast, we can simply inform individuals and attract an audience to the Sitio Bebe by outlining our fundraising plan. We will inform them about the fundraising proposal's planned events. With the use of this, we can simply inform people about the preparations and our performances, causing the audience to become excited.<p>

    <div class="box">
      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Target Audience</h2>
      <p style="text-align: center;">Our target audience are mainly adolescents and teenagers who are becoming young adults. Basically, people who are of generation Z, as well as a niche-specific demographic that coincides with the theme of the concert, as well as people who are into pinoy pop and rock, punk rock, and alternative music and bands, would be interested in the concert. </p>
   <p style="text-align: center;">We chose these people as our target audience because they have an interest in particular music that is the same as the artists we had at the concert. Those artists we had at the concert are a mix of old-school and fresh faces in the music industry. With this, it would attract people's attention, contribute to gaining more people to watch our concert, and help us gain more funds for the Sitio Bebe.<p>

    <div class="box">
      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Needs</h2>
      <p style="text-align: center;">This type of content is a need as it brings in comfort and reassurance that teenagers need, basically like therapy. They share stories that the listeners can relate to so that they won't feel alone and have a sense of community. Giving out advice and talking about topics people don't often talk about, normalizing these normal things society has shunned upon giving a sense of liberty and hope to our individual selves.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"> As for the opinion based podcasts that share their life and opinion, it also brings a sense of community where the listeners are not alone and that there are people like them who think the same.<p>
